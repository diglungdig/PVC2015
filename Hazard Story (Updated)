Setting
  2285 AD
  Second Great Industrial Age
  The System Gliese 667 (Triple star system)
    The Dostra-7 asteroid belt around the binary stars
  Research facility owned by the Bivratum Industries
    Name: Sestra Research Facility
    Research facility uses Nuclear (?) power 
    Made of ceramic?
    Facility has been abandoned (may have certain parts in ruins)
      There could be corrosion 
  Facility can be hidden inside asteroid (company wants to hide the base from the GSC)

Story
  Protagonist (named Charles) is hired by Bivratum Industries
  The facility was abandoned by the scientists because they don’t want the corporation to get their hands on the technology
  Starts in the hangar, tell player to get helper robot and helmet, step out
  Try to power the station (may or may not work
  Go to the third floor try to find research data 
  The player will have a choice at the end to destroy the station (because player finds that corp is evil) or return it (that’s the ignorance route of not finding the audio logs)
    I still say we have the option of the player taking the time warp robot with him so we can have a second chapter
