C# script: A generator that can build room with regular/random shape(T & L shape for right now) at runtime based on tiles(unity prefab).
A script written in a flexile way that simply changing prefab in the editor can give the room a totally different look.

This script is still under development. 
Fully designed by Wei.

Theoretically there will be two generator scripts in the game. One is called RoomGenerator, and the other will be called MapGenerator. 
MapGenerator will bring all the game objects that are attached with RoomGenerator.cs together to build a map and then establish passageways among them.
